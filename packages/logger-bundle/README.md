This bundle allows you to log information that happens in your system. The logger can optionally output to `console.log` but later on, as your system grows, all of your instances should output to a centralised log management place. This is why we strongly recommend, as you're building your app, to use `LoggerService` instead of `console.log`

## Install

```bash
npm install --save @bluelibs/logger-bundle
