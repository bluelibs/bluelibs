Please keep in mind the tips below when formulating a question:

- A good meaningful title so the question is easily understood
- Give us context. If there's a problem how did you arrive to this problem, what aspects does it impact?
- Feel free to share your possible outcomes. Often when we transmit how we would see a solution, we give the person a better understanding of our question.

If you are pasting code, please keep in mind the following tips:

- For code use GitHub's code blocks please also specify the language (typescript/js/jsx) etc
- Please indent the code that you want to paste
- Leave meaningful comments if the code is too large so anyone can easily understand it
