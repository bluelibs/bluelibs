## About BlueLibs

BlueLibs is a collection of open-source products which help you quickly prototype web applications and scale your app while respecting [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles. This is [our official website](https://www.bluelibs.com), this is [our documentation page](https://www.bluelibs.com/docs/).

Features:

- üëâ [Dependency Injection & Module Management](https://www.bluelibs.com/docs/package-core)
- üëâ Database-agnostic and fully featured [Security System](https://www.bluelibs.com/docs/package-security)
- üëâ Server-agnostic [GraphQL Integration](https://www.bluelibs.com/docs/package-graphql) with [Apollo](https://www.bluelibs.com/docs/package-apollo)
- üëâ [MongoDB](https://www.bluelibs.com/docs/package-mongo) & [PostgreSQL](https://www.bluelibs.com/docs/package-sql) Integrations
- üëâ Rapid Prototyping via [Blueprint](https://www.bluelibs.com/products/blueprint/) and [X-Framework](https://www.bluelibs.com/products/x-framework/)
- üëâ [Code Generation Tooling](https://www.bluelibs.com/docs/package-x-cli)
- üëâ [GraphQL Live Data for Single Documents & Queries](https://www.bluelibs.com/docs/package-x-bundle#live-data) via X-Framework

## Get Started

Our rapid prototyping solution (Blueprint for X-Framework) is tightly coupled to GraphQL and MongoDB. BlueLibs as a whole isn't. and supports [SQL](https://www.bluelibs.com/docs/package-sql).

```bash
# Install MongoDB & Node 14+
npm i -g @bluelibs/x
x # pick project and complete it there
cd project
npm run blueprint:generate
npm run start:api
npm run start:admin # Start after API has started
```

## Learning BlueLibs

We have designed a custom [documentation](https://www.bluelibs.com/docs) experience with custom code snippets and challenges.

## Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability within BlueLibs packages, please send an e-mail to Theodor Diaconu via [theodor@bluelibs.com](mailto:theodor@bluelibs.com). All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

## Repository Structure

This monorepo is split like this:

- ./templates/\* things that are re-usable, like a new package template and others
- ./scripts/\* things we use for internal development
- ./packages/\* where all packages lie
- ./assets/\* things needed for GitHub README page

We use lerna so when you are in development phase you could use `lerna link`, and for example if your package depends on another package, for example, `logger-bundle` depends on `core`, you go to `logger-bundle` you run `lerna link`, then go to `core` and run `npm run watch`, now logger-bundle will use the updated variant of `core`.

If you want to try your new changes to an external application (outside this monorepo), the solution is to use `bluelibs-package-replace` binary:

```bash
# From Monorepo Root
chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/bluelibs-package-replace
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/bluelibs-package-replace `pwd`/scripts/bluelibs-package-replace
```

Now go to your `microservice` and simply run `bluelibs-package-replace x-ui`. This will properly update your package version to the one you have in the monorepo. Make sure you're also watching changes in `x-ui` package via `npm run watch`.

Each package uses jest and ts-jest for development testing:

```bash
npm run test:dev
```

To run tests in C.I, we have the command `npm run test` which compiles the code and runs the final tests.
