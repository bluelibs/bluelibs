In this post, we're going to explore how easy it is to have live data that reflects the current view of the database. Let's take together a closer look of how Live Data is being handled in the X-Framework.

## What is Live Data ?

There can be many terms for it, reactive data, real-time, you name it. They all might refer to the same thing, the data you see is the actual up to date data, meaning you won't have to refresh the page to see it.

Live Data can be achieved either through polling or through websockets. There are advantages and disadvantages to both approaches, however in our case we're using Websockets.

## Usage

First of all you can find an working example in the [x-boilerplate](https://github.com/bluelibs/x-boilerplate) so you can start playing with it.

Let's explore our API a little bit starting from the server. [Looks more elegant in the boilerplate](https://github1s.com/bluelibs/x-boilerplate/blob/main/microservices/api/src/bundles/AppBundle/graphql/subscriptions/postsSubscription.resolvers.ts)

```ts
// PS: this is much more elegant
import * as X from "@bluelibs/x-bundle";
import { Collection } from "@bluelibs/mongo-bundle";

// Our wrapper for Mongo Collections + TypeSafety
class PostsCollection extends Collection {
  static collectionName = "posts";

  static behaviors = [X.Behaviors.Live()];
}

// Read more: https://bluelibs.com/docs/package-x-bundle#live-data
const resolvers = {
  Subscription: {
    postsSubscription: {
      resolve: (payload) => payload,
      subscribe: X.ToSubscription(PostsCollection),
    },
  },
};

const typeDefs = `
  type Subscriptions {
    postsSubscription(body: EJSON): SubscriptionEvent!
  }
`;
```

Now that we've set everything up, on the client it's very easy:

```ts
import { Collection } from "@bluelibs/x-ui";

class PostsCollection extends Collection<Post> {
  getName() {
    return "posts";
  }
}

// Read more: https://bluelibs.com/docs/package-x-ui#live-data
function LiveDataPage() {
  const { data: posts, isLoading, error } = useLiveData(
    PostsCollection,
    {
      filters: {},
      options: {},
    },
    {
      title: 1,
      // Relational queries
      comments: {
        text: 1,
        author: {
          fullName: 1,
        },
      },
    }
  );

  // Alternative: useLiveDataOne(collection, _id, body) for single documents
}
```

That was it, that's how easy it is to setup live data with React & X-Framework:

1. You setup the `postsSubscription` on server
2. You use the built-in hooks: `useLiveData` or `useLiveDataOne`

You can easily switch between live data and non-live data by simply using `useData` instead of `useLiveData`. They have the same signature which makes it perfect for the developer to use and easily change depending on use-cases.

## How does it work?

If you want live data on collections you'll have to add the `X.Behaviors.Live()` behavior which basically allows the collection to emit mutation events to the Messenger. For example:

- We detected a new insertion for `collection` with this `_id`
- We detected a new removal for `collection` with this `_id`
- This `collection document` with this `id` has updated the following fields: `["f1", "f2"]`

Without adding this behavior, live data will not work as expected, you can ofcourse subscribe and fetch the data, but any change that happens afterwards will not be triggered.

The messenger is a pubsub system. In layman's terms it's a distributed event manager. While you are developing locally we are using an in-memory one, however if you deploy and have more than one backend server, you have to
move to a distributed one. Redis Messenger is built-in but you are not bound to it. [Here](https://bluelibs.com/docs/package-x-bundle#deployment--customisation) you will see that you can implement your own custom communication channel.

On the processing side what happens on the server is this:

1. We get the request from the client stating it wants to subscribe
2. We create an in-memory collection with current data-set and we watch the communications channel
3. If we get updates, we check if we can update accordingly and send `patch` events downstream to the client

We have some nice optimisations here such as:

1. If two users subscribe to the same "publication" it will get re-used
2. When subscribing to document id or ids, it's very efficient to just patch the data.

## Conclusion

Live data should be simple and scalable. We want to enable developers to have live reactive data without polling and without thinking to much about it, we want it to just work and deliver amazing experiences to their customers.

We recommend to check it out:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:bluelibs/x-boilerplate.git live
cd live ; scripts/setup.sh
```

And run both the api and ui microservices:

```bash
npm run start:api
# In another terminal
npm run start:ui
```

## Give a star to BlueLibs

Dear developer, we at BlueLibs are working to solve the hard problems of web-development. It would be helpful for us to get traction and allow other developers
to discover BlueLibs. So, [give a star, to BlueLibs](https://github.com/bluelibs/bluelibs)!
