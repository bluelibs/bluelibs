import { PackageHeader } from "@site/src/components/PackageHeader";

<PackageHeader version="1.0.1" packageName="x-password-bundle"  />

This package from X-Framework gives you fully integrated passwords system, with GraphQL endpoints and customisable emails. This bundle makes use of the original `PasswordBundle` to allow-it plug-in into your X-stack.

## Install

```typescript
import { XPasswordBundle } from "@bluelibs/x-password-bundle";

// For this to work you need the following: SecurityBundle, ApolloBundle, ApolloSecurityBundle, SecurityMongoBundle, XBundle

kernel.addBundle(new XPasswordBundle());
```

Ensure you have a type user in your graphql, or disable the me query:

```typescript file="graphql/entities/User.graphql.ts"
type User {
  _id: ObjectID!
}
```

```ts
new XPasswordBundle({
  graphql: {
    queries: {
      me: false,
    },
  },
});
```

## Emails

We have the following emails setup:

1. `Welcome` once that user has registered
2. `Verify Email` when we want to verify the user's email
3. `Forgot Password` to receive the reset password link on your email
4. `Reset Password Confirmation` after you've reset your password you'll get a confirmation.

All these emails can be overriden like this:

### Customise

```tsx
import { IReactEmailTemplate } from "@bluelibs/email-bundle";
import { IWelcomeEmailProps } from "@bluelibs/x-password-bundle";

export const CustomWelcomeEmail: IReactEmailTemplate<IWelcomeEmailProps> = (
  props
) => (
  <div>
    <p>Hello {props.name},</p>
    Go here: <a href={props.welcomeUrl}>{props.welcomeUrl}</a>
    <p>
      Regards, <br />
      {props.regardsName}
    </p>
  </div>
);

new XPasswordBundle({
  emails: {
    templates: {
      welcome: CustomWelcomeEmail,
      verifyEmail: "...",
      forgotPassword: "...",
      resetPasswordConfirmation: "...",
    },
  },
});
```

## Registration Flow

- User registers with `firstName`, `lastName`, `email` and `password`
- We assume that the username will be the email. This can be customised by you.
- If verify email is enabled, the `VerifyEmail` will be sent (if `sendEmailVerification` )
  - After the email gets verified, the `WelcomeEmail` is sent (if `sendWelcomeEmail` is enabled)
- If verify email is disabled and `sendWelcomeEmail` is enabled, the `WelcomeEmail` will be initially sent.

By default user is able to login without having the email verified. However, using the `emails.requiresEmailVerificationBeforeLoggingIn` config on the bundle, this will not be an option. The `register` will return a null token and user cannot login until his email gets verified.

This is done by playing with `isEnabled` from `IUser` which doesn't allow the user to login.

After email gets verified, `isEnabled` is marked as true.

:::caution
If you later introduce processes of email verification (like when he changes the email, etc) please note that we mark `isEnabled` to true. So if you have suspended the user and somehow he can request an email verification, be careful.

### Urls

You can also modify the paths based on the X-Framework application url:

```ts
new XPasswordBundle({
  emails: {
    paths: {
      welcomePath: "/welcome",
      resetPasswordPath: "/reset-password/:token",
      verifyEmailPath: "/verify-email/:token",
    },
  },
});
```

### Other Configuration

```ts
new XPasswordBundle({
  emails: {
    applicationName: "My App";
    regardsName: "My App Team";
    // Sometimes the email verification can be the welcome one
    // In that case, don't send an welcome email and customise your email verification one
    sendEmailVerification: true;
    sendWelcomeEmail: true;
  }
  // Don't allow users with email unverified to login:
  requiresEmailVerificationBeforeLoggingIn: false,
})
```

## Mutations

Once you added this bundle, you will see some mutations appearing in your GraphQL docs, these can be toggled on/off using this:

```ts
// The configuration is:
export interface IXPasswordBundleConfig {
  graphql: {
    mutations: {
      register: boolean;
      changePassword: boolean;
      login: boolean;
      logout: boolean;
      resetPassword: boolean;
      forgotPassword: boolean;
      verifyEmail: boolean;
    };
  };
}
```

## Custom Registration

By default registration accepts `firstName`, `lastName`, `email` and `password`. If you have a more complex registration, we recommend disabling `register` mutation as shown above and implement your own:

```graphql
input RegisterInput {
  email: String!
  password: String!
  firstName: String!
  lastName: String!
}

type RegisterResponse {
  token: String
}

type Mutation {
  register(input: RegisterInput!): RegisterResponse
}
```

```ts
import { IGraphQLContext, InputType } from "@bluelibs/graphql-bundle";
import { RegisterInput, XPasswordService } from "@bluelibs/x-password-bundle";

class MyCustomInput extends RegisterInput {
  age: string;
}

function register(_, args: InputType<RegisterInput>, context: IGraphQLContext) {
  const { input } = args;
  const xPasswordService = context.container.get(XPasswordService);

  const { email, password, firstName, lastName } = input;
  const { userId, token } = xPasswordService.register({
    email,
    password,
    firstName,
    lastName,
  });

  // Do additional operations, call another service with the "age" part.
  return {
    token,
  };
}
```

## Override Logic

You can modify behavior of your mutation resolvers by creating your own `XPasswordService`:

```ts
import { RegistrationInput, XPasswordService } from "@bluelibs/x-password-bundle";

class MyXPasswordService extends XPasswordService {
  register(input: RegistrationInput) {
    // Do your thingie here.
    // Or you can disable the mutation, and simply implement your own.
  }
}

// ...
new XPasswordBundle({
  services: {
    XPasswordService: MyXPasswordService,
  },
});
```
