import { PackageHeader } from "@site/src/components/PackageHeader";

<PackageHeader version="1.2.0" packageName="apollo-bundle" containsTypeDefs />

## Install

```bash
npm i -S graphql @bluelibs/graphql-bundle apollo-server-express @bluelibs/apollo-bundle
```

```ts
import { ApolloBundle } from "@bluelibs/apollo-bundle";

const kernel = new Kernel({
  bundles: [new GraphQLBundle(), new ApolloBundle()],
});
```

## Purpose

Apollo is the current leader on `Node` in terms of implementing GraphQL for the server, their tooling is fantastic and we can use it seamlessly. There are various server implementations that exist: `koa`, `lambda` (serverless). We are using the standard one alongside with `express` which enables us to also add additional routes.

However, keep in mind, that this strategy allows you to easily `swap` servers without performing modifications to your code, since the definitions are loaded separately through the `GraphQLBundle`.

The integration provides you with:

- Access to `container` from the GraphQL Context
- Express app for custom routes (webhooks, downloads, etc)
- Subscription Support
- JIT compilation of your GraphQL supercharging the speeds.

The `express` application and `ApolloServer` are created in the `KernelAfterInit` event. So, in essence, server starts when all bundles have been successfully initialised.

## Usage

```typescript
import { ApolloBundle } from "@bluelibs/apollo-bundle";

kernel.addBundle(
  new ApolloBundle({
    // (optional) The port it starts on
    port: 4000,

    // (optional) This is more on the informative side, to explicitly state the final endpoint of your app
    url: "http://localhost:4000",

    // (optional) Apollo additional configuration
    apollo: ApolloServerExpressConfig,

    // (optional) Whether to install websocket handlers
    enableSubscriptions: false,

    // (optional) Express middlewares:
    middlewares: [],

    // (optional) Server Side Routes
    // You can also add them from your bundle via `.addRoute()`
    routes: [
      {
        type: "post", // "get", "put", "all"
        path: "/api/payment-handler/:orderId",
        handler: async (container, req, res) => {},
        // These are optional and used for body-parsing
        json: true,
        urlencoded: true,
      },
    ],

    // Use uploads: false if you want to disable support for file uploading via graphql-upload
    uploads: {
      maxFileSize: 1024 * 1024 * 1000, // 1000 mega bytes, default is 10e9
      maxFiles: 10, // how many files can a user upload at once?
    },

    // Enables/disables JIT decoding for GRAPHQL
    jit: true,
  })
);
```

## Loading API Definitions

```typescript
import { Bundle } from "@bluelibs/core";
import { Loader } from "@bluelibs/graphql-bundle";

class AppBundle extends Bundle {
  prepare() {
    const loader = this.get<Loader>(Loader);

    loader.load({
      typeDefs: `
        type Query {
          sayHello: String
        }
      `,
      resolvers: {
        Query: {
          sayHello: (_, args, ctx) => {
            // You have access to the kernel container via: ctx.container
            return "Hello world!";
          },
        },
      },
      contextReducers: async function storeUser(ctx) {
        // Note that if you have subscriptions enabled
        // You'll have to read from connectionParams rather than req and manually identify whether its HTTP vs Subscription
        return {
          ...ctx,
          userId: "XXX",
        };
      },
    });
  }
}
```

## Internals

```ts
import { ApolloBundle } from "@bluelibs/apollo-bundle";

class AppBundle extends Bundle {
  async prepare() {
    const apolloBundle = this.container.get(ApolloBundle);

    // Express App
    apolloBundle.app;

    // Node HTTP Server from 'http'
    apolloBundle.httpServer;

    // ApolloServer instance
    apolloBundle.server;

    // Subscription service (if they are enabled)
    apolloBundle.subscriptionServer;
  }
}
```

## Playground

If you want to benefit of the built-in playground for Apollo we recommend you do this:

```ts
import { ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground } from "apollo-server-core";

new ApolloBundle({
  apollo: {
    plugins: [
      ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground({
        /* options */
      }),
    ],
  },
});
```

## Meta

### Summary

Easy to use `ApolloServer` for your BlueLibs Application that contains lots of great stuff but also gives you the ability to fully customise `ApolloServer`.

### Boilerplates

- [ApolloBundle](https://stackblitz.com/edit/node-cbokfp?file=src%2Fapollo%2Findex.ts)
  - Use `/graphql` in the render part to access GraphQL Playground and run a query: `getUsers { name }`

### Challenges

- Create a JWT user authentication mechanism that reads from the request headers and puts the userId in the context (3p)
- Create an easy subscription system which triggers an event every second (2p)
- Create a mutation in which you upload a text file and as a response gives you its contents (1p)
