# BlueLibs Main Website

The documentation is built based on the packages that are defined and a script copies their documentation and builds the sidebar.

It should contain a boilerplate for a package bare-bones

The concept is that your package has a DOCUMENTATION.md that describes what the package does and provides a link to the official documentation website: bluelibs.com/docs/package-{package}. If it contains links to documentation outside the package, it will point to bluelibs.com.

The documentation of a package should contain:

- Link to API Docs
- How to install
- How to add and use
- Explanations and API usage

Later on, packages should be able to be versioned, by automatically detecting the tags, and creating different versions of them.
